LocalAssets (Chrome Browser Extension)
======================================

I manage fairly large content websites, and do most of the development work locally. I use git/svn for code. But it gets frustrating to see broken image src links. Only solution is to download the whole "assets" folder to get a production-like view of the site.

This browser extension helps by replacing the image src links with production ones. You have the ability to configure hosts, find and replace strings. After saving the configuration, you can view your locally hosted sites with proper images.
